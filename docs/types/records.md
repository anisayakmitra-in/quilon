# Records
Anonymous structs with named fields:
```quilon
user = { name = "Alice", age = 30 }
n    = user.name
```
Fields may hold any type — `Text`, arrays, nested arrays, etc. — and read back at
their real type (no numeric-only restriction). (See `examples/records.qn` and
`examples/composites.qn`, which exercises a `Text` record field, an array of `Text`,
and a nested array together.)

## Named record types with methods
Methods take an implicit `it` (the receiver):
```quilon
User = {
  name :: Text,
  age  :: Num,
  greet   = => "Hello, " + it.name,
  olderBy = years => it.age + years
}

u = User { name = "Alice", age = 30 }
g = u.greet()          ~ "Hello, Alice"
a = u.olderBy(5)       ~ 35
```
(See `examples/methods.qn`.)

A method is a **setter** (mutating) iff its body writes `it.field := …` (or calls
another setter on `it`); there is no marker — the visible `:=` *is* the signal.
Calling a setter requires a mutable (`:=`) receiver (see [Mutation](../mutation.md)).
